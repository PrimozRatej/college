        President <span id="odebeljeno">Barack Obama</span> is in Cuba for a historic three-day visit to the island and talks with its communist leader. He is the first sitting US president to visit since the 1959 revolution, which heralded decades of hostility between the two countries.
        Mr Obama said change would happen in Cuba and that Cuban President Raul Castro understood that. The two leaders are meeting to talk about trade and are scheduled to hold a joint news conference.
